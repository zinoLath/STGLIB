# stgLib
stgLib is a heavily modified THlib, which is a lua codebase to be used with LuaSTG to make Touhou Project-like games.

New features include:
- BMF font rendering, with rich text functionality using XML
- Expansive dialogue system, also using XML for flow and rich text
- Bullets which are colored inside the code, using RGB
- Rewritten modules (enemies, bosses, bullets, players, items, lasers)
- Expansive menu system

**ATTENTION: THIS REPOSITORY IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS (IT IS CURRENLY MID PORTING, ORIGINAL CODEBASE WAS WRITTEN FOR LUASTG-X). FEATURES ABOVE ARE NOT GUARANTEED TO BE IMPLEMENTED CURRENTLY.**
